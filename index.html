    Hello!
    <p>
    I am really excited to be in this bootcamp with all of you.  
    Like many of the other stories shared by others, I also find 
    that working in HTML and CSS really allows me to focus on my 
    creative side.  I am not as skilled in Javascript and most of the 
    back end database tools so I'm really excited about learning these parts. 
    </p>
    <p>
    On a personal side, I'm 42 years old.  I have been married to my wife Dana for 
    19 years and have two amazing kids. Piper is 14 and just entered Highschool at Cherokee trails in Southeast Aurora, Co, 
    and my son Max is almost 11 and is in 5th grade.  Outside of work, I enjoy many
    hobbies, which includes virtual flight simulation, restoring my 1973 VW convertible beetle
    and taking care of my 150 gallon saltwater fish tank.  
    </p>
